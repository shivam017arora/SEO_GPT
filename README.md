## SeoGPT
SeoGPT, an AI model specifically designed for search engine optimization (SEO).


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# How Does it Work
1. Input Query: The user provides a query or a piece of text related to their SEO needs.

2. Topic Generation: SeoGPT processes the input query and generates a topic based on the provided information. This topic serves as a foundation for further analysis and suggestion generation.

3. Keyword Extraction: Once the topic is generated, an API is called to get keywords and their search volume, CPC and paid competition.

4. Suggestion Generation: Using the extracted keywords, SeoGPT generates suggestions based on the provided text or query.

5. Output Presentation: a list of recommended keywords.
